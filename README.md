## Multiple Rules Payment Checkout

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project was created for the purpose of demonstrating my front end development skills in React and Redux. Code is created with testability, maintainability with mind. [Demo](http://gdp-ads-checkout.surge.sh/) is hosted using surge.sh.

The app is designed to be usable at both desktop and mobile devices.

Webpack is configured to load Sass without sacrificing the original PostCss loader.

## Available Scripts

```
git clone https://github.com/wengkhing/gdp-ads-checkout
```

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

or

### `npm start`

This script runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

or

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>


## Improvement Suggestions
- Althought the app can be view from mobile browser without a problem, it can still be slightly tuned to improve user experience from mobile.
- Inventory system can be added to further demonstrate the checkout function
- Allow modification of special rules (admin)
